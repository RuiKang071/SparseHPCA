Title: Sparse Heteroskedastic PCA in High Dimensions
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Rui Kang; Peiliang Zhang; Ren Zhao
Maintainer: Rui Kang <ruk18@pitt.edu>
Description: Provides a novel method for estimating the loading matrix in the presence of the heteroskedastic noise. We focus on the high-dimensional settings where dimension p is allowed to be far larger than sample size n and implement the method using thresholding, orthogonal iterations, and diagonal imputation. Other functions in the package including sample generation and initial estimation. Windows users should install 'Rtools' before the installation of this package.
